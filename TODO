-Add photo to nutrient activity / API response and display

-Resize user image in saved activity

-Add alternate resources for other activities to make sure landscape doesn't look bad
    -main (OK as default)
    -list (OK as default)
    -pager (images need to be sized, but that could be done in normal layout, otherwise OK)
    -about (definitely needs an alternate resource)


-Make sure user only sees their saved foods and not others
